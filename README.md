# max-and-unlock
Utility for adjusting amounts, levels and unlocks in The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners save files.

This utility was originally used to modify PCVR save files, but has been verified to function with save files exported from The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Chapter 1 intended for use with the import function of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Chapter 2: Retribution.

This utility will not add ammunition, materials or crafting tables that are not already in the save file. It will only adjust amounts of those which already have entries in the save file.

In order to include and adjust Chapter 2 ammo, materials and table levels you will need a save that already includes these. One can be found described and linked in the video linked below.
